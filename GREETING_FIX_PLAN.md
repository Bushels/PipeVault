# Customer Greeting Fix

This note captures why earlier AI edits (Claude/Gemini) failed to surface the welcome banner on the customer dashboard and how to address it reliably.

## What Went Wrong
- **Wrong component** – The customer “dashboard” screen is actually `components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`. Claude and Gemini edited `Dashboard.tsx`, which only renders after a legacy session handshake, so their greetings never appeared in production.
- **Metadata-only lookup** – The earlier code in `Dashboard.tsx` read `user.user_metadata.full_name/company_name`. Many existing accounts predate those fields, leaving the greeting blank.
- **No session fallback** – Even when metadata is missing we have other sources (`session.company`, sign-in email, stored request contact names). Ignoring them meant empty greetings for most users.
- **Debug noise** – Claude left a `console.log('dY"? User metadata check', …)` block in `Dashboard.tsx`. It spammed the console without solving the missing data problem.
- **Fragile logout** – `WelcomeScreen` forced a hard `window.location.reload()` on sign-out. When Supabase rejected the sign-out (stale token, network hiccup), the reload rehydrated the old session, trapping the user on the dashboard.

## Fix Plan
1. **Derive name from multiple sources**  
   - Primary: `user.user_metadata.full_name` (Supabase auth metadata).  
   - Secondary: first matching `storage_requests[].requestDetails.fullName` for the signed-in user.  
   - Tertiary: `session.userId` (falls back to the email prefix).
2. **Always show the company name**  
   - Prefer `user.user_metadata.company_name`, otherwise use `session.company.name`, which is already populated by the session bootstrap.
3. **Cleanup**  
   - Remove the stray debug log to avoid console spam.
4. **Render logic**  
   - Keep the greeting visible whenever either a name or company can be determined.  
   - Label format: `Welcome, {displayName}{company ? \` from ${company}\` : ''}!`.

## Implementation Notes
- Update only `components/Dashboard.tsx`. No other consumers rely on the broken helper.
- Leverage existing `requests` prop to find a fallback name without extra queries.
- Unit tests are not present in this repo; manual verification: log in as a customer with/without metadata and ensure the banner renders using the new fallbacks.

## Implementation Summary
- Introduced `utils/customerIdentity.ts` so both `Dashboard` and `WelcomeScreen` derive the customer name/company from metadata, stored requests, and the sign-in email.
- Updated `Dashboard.tsx` and `WelcomeScreen.tsx` to surface the new greeting and default the company label to the resolved identity rather than just metadata.
- Replaced the brittle `window.location.reload()` logout in `WelcomeScreen` with a controlled sign-out that resets local state, avoiding the stuck-session issue.
