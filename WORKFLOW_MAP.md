## 🔒 Security & Data Isolation

### **Magic Link Implementation**
```javascript
// Secure token structure
{
  email: "josh@summitdrilling.com",
  projectRef: "AFE-158970-1",
  requestId: "REQ-2024-03-001",
  issued: "2024-03-01T15:30:00Z",
  expires: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z", // 10 months
  signature: "SHA256_HMAC..."
}
```

### **Customer Data Scoping**
```
Customer AI queries are filtered by:
  WHERE email = session.email
  AND projectRef = session.projectRef

Customers can ONLY see/query their own data.
```

### **Admin Permissions**
```
Admin AI has full access but requires confirmation:
  "You're about to change the status of 15 requests.
   Are you sure? [Yes] [No]"
```

```

### **2. Intelligent Defaults**
```
AI learns from previous interactions:
  "I see you usually schedule deliveries on Wednesdays at 10am.
   Should I check that time slot first?"
```

### **3. Error Handling**
```
If AI misunderstands:
  Customer: "Actually that's wrong"
  AI: "No problem! What should I change? You can say things like:
      • 'Change the grade to P110'
      • 'Actually it's 130 joints'
      • 'Wrong phone number, it's 555-...'
```

### **4. Contextual Help**
```
Customer: "I'm confused"
AI: "I can help! What would you like to know?
    • What's a project reference number?
    • What's the difference between NUE and BTC connections?

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Review this workflow map** with your team
2. **Prioritize features** based on business needs
3. **Choose AI provider** (Claude, OpenAI, or both)
4. **Design database schema** for conversations and sessions
5. **Create UI mockups** for chat interface

**Questions to Consider:**

1. Should the AI handle pricing/billing discussions?
2. What happens if customer never returns after approval?
3. Should there be a timeout for scheduled deliveries?
4. Can customers modify requests after submission?
5. How to handle partial pickups (only some joints)?
6. Should AI suggest alternative storage if preferred location is full?
7. Integration with existing MPS systems?
8. Multi-language support needed?
